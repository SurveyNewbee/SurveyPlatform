name: ethnography
description: |
  Observes real-world behaviors, contexts, and interactions to uncover unmet needs and explain the gap between what people say and do. Use when behaviors are habitual, unconscious, or when survey responses fail to explain actual actions in natural settings. Typically involves 8-20 participants observed in-context through home visits, shop-alongs, or workplace shadowing. Not suitable for testing hypotheses, measuring market size, or situations requiring statistical generalization.

# Ethnography Research (Contextual Observation & Meaning-Making)

## Overview
Ethnography Research is a methodology used to **understand what people actually do in real contexts, and why**, by observing behaviors, environments, and interactions rather than relying solely on self-report. It is applied when needs are latent, behaviors are habitual or unconscious, or when survey responses fail to explain real-world actions.

This methodology focuses on **context, meaning, and discrepancy**—the gap between what people say and what they do—and is foundational for uncovering unmet needs, design opportunities, and strategic insight.

## Core Principles
- **Behavior precedes explanation.** Observation comes before interpretation.
- **Context creates meaning.** Environment, constraints, and social dynamics shape behavior.
- **People are unreliable narrators of habit.** Ethnography compensates for recall and rationalization bias.
- **Small samples, deep insight.** Depth is prioritized over statistical generalization.
- **Patterns matter more than anecdotes.** Insights emerge from repeated themes across cases.
- **Translation to action is mandatory.** Observations must convert into design, product, or strategy implications.

## Survey / Study Design Requirements

### Study Structure
- **Select ethnography mode based on access and risk:**
  - In-home or in-context observation
  - Accompanied shop-alongs
  - Workplace shadowing
  - Mobile or diary-based self-ethnography
  - Remote video or photo-based tasks
- **Define a clear focal behavior or question.**
  - Avoid open-ended “see what happens” designs.
- **Recruit participants based on behavior, not attitude.**
  - Screen on recent, relevant actions.
- **Plan for immersion, not interrogation.**
  - Observation time must exceed questioning time.
- **Use a consistent observation framework:**
  1. Context and setting
  2. Trigger or goal
  3. Actions and workarounds
  4. Tools and artifacts used
  5. Emotional or cognitive signals
  6. Social interactions
- **Include light, reflective probing after observation.**
  - Ask about meaning after behavior is documented.
- **Document with multiple data types.**
  - Notes, photos, video, artifacts, screen captures.

### Question & Prompt Design
- **Use open, non-leading prompts.**
  - “Walk me through what you’re doing.”
  - “What’s happening here?”
- **Avoid “why” questions during action.**
  - Ask “why” only after the behavior is complete.
- **Use contrast prompts post-hoc.**
  - “Is this typical or unusual?”
  - “What happens when this doesn’t work?”
- **Do not validate or judge behavior.**
  - Neutral stance is required.
- **Limit direct questioning.**
  - Ethnography is not a depth interview with props.

### Sample Observation Prompts
- “Please show me how you normally [perform task].”
- “What do you do next?”
- “What tools or information are you relying on right now?”
- “What usually goes wrong here?”
- “If you had to do this again tomorrow, what would you change?”

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Turning ethnography into interviewing.**
  - *Wrong:* Long Q&A sessions with minimal observation.
  - *Correct:* Letting behavior lead.
- **Over-generalizing from a single case.**
  - Insights must be pattern-based.
- **Ignoring environmental constraints.**
  - Contextual barriers are often the insight.
- **Asking participants to perform for the researcher.**
  - Encourage normal, not idealized behavior.
- **Failing to document rigorously.**
  - Memory-based synthesis is unreliable.
- **Delivering “interesting stories” without implications.**
  - Ethnography must drive decisions.

## Analysis & Output Requirements
- **Synthesize data across cases, not within individuals.**
- **Primary analytical lenses include:**
  - Repeated behaviors and workarounds
  - Pain points and friction moments
  - Unmet or unarticulated needs
  - Emotional highs and lows
  - Social and environmental influences
- **Code observations systematically.**
  - Use thematic coding, not verbatim transcription alone.
- **Identify tensions and contradictions.**
  - What people say vs what they do
  - Intended process vs actual process
- **Key outputs typically include:**
  - Behavioral frameworks or models
  - Need-state definitions
  - Opportunity areas
  - Design principles
  - Illustrative evidence (photos, clips, quotes)
- **Sample size guidance:**
  - Typically 8–20 participants per distinct behavior group
- **Avoid quantification.**
  - Ethnography informs hypotheses; it does not test them.

## Integration with Other Methods
- **Survey Research:** Translate ethnographic insights into structured measures.
- **Journey Mapping:** Ground journeys in observed behavior.
- **Product Use Testing:** Explain why usage succeeds or fails.
- **Concept Development:** Inspire solution ideation.
- **Usability Testing:** Identify friction not captured in tasks.
