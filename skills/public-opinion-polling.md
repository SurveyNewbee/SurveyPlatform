description: |
  Measures public attitudes, beliefs, and issue priorities with population-representative rigor for generalization and trend tracking. Use when accuracy, neutrality, and public credibility are critical - typically for political, policy, social, or reputational contexts requiring transparent methodology. Prioritizes representativeness over convenience sampling and maintains strict question neutrality. Not suitable for commercial product decisions, private stakeholder research, or studies where leading questions are acceptable.

# Public Opinion Polling (Population Attitudes & Issue Measurement)

## Overview
Public Opinion Polling is a methodology used to **measure attitudes, beliefs, priorities, and preferences of a defined population** in a way that supports generalization, trend tracking, and public reporting. It is applied in political, policy, social, reputational, and large-scale brand contexts where **accuracy, neutrality, and credibility** are critical.

This methodology prioritizes **representativeness, question discipline, and transparency**, recognizing that small design errors can materially distort results.

## Core Principles
- **Representativeness is non-negotiable.** Samples must reflect the target population, not just respondents.
- **Neutrality in wording is mandatory.** Questions must not lead, frame, or persuade.
- **Trends matter more than point estimates.** Stability and comparability over time are paramount.
- **Salience differs from agreement.** What people care about is not the same as what they support.
- **Uncertainty must be acknowledged.** Margins of error and limitations are part of the output.
- **Public trust depends on transparency.** Methods must be fully disclosable.

## Survey Design Requirements

### Question Structure
- **Define the population explicitly.**
  - National adults
  - Registered voters
  - Likely voters
  - Residents of a specific geography
- **Begin with broad, non-leading questions.**
  - Avoid priming respondents with detailed context early.
- **Sequence questions carefully:**
  1. Issue salience and priority
  2. General attitudes and beliefs
  3. Specific policy or proposal evaluation
  4. Trade-offs and conditional views
  5. Demographics (at the end)
- **Use balanced question framing.**
  - Present both sides where relevant.
- **Avoid double-barreled questions.**
  - One idea per question.
- **Randomize response options where order bias is possible.**
- **Use split samples deliberately.**
  - Test wording effects or framing without contaminating results.
- **Lock wording once tracking begins.**
  - Any change requires a documented break.

### Scale Design
- **Use standard 4- or 5-point opinion scales.**
  - Example: “Strongly support” → “Strongly oppose”
- **Include explicit “don’t know” or “no opinion” options.**
  - Forced opinions inflate noise.
- **Use intensity measures sparingly.**
  - Strength of feeling is distinct from direction.
- **Maintain identical scales across waves.**
- **Avoid unusual or novel scale formats.**
  - Familiarity improves reliability.

### Sample Questions
**Issue Salience**
- “What do you think is the most important problem facing the country today?”
  - Open-ended

**General Attitude**
- “Do you approve or disapprove of the way [institution/leader] is handling their responsibilities?”
  - Strongly approve
  - Somewhat approve
  - Somewhat disapprove
  - Strongly disapprove
  - Don’t know

**Policy Support**
- “Would you favor or oppose a proposal to [describe policy in neutral terms]?”
  - Strongly favor
  - Somewhat favor
  - Somewhat oppose
  - Strongly oppose
  - No opinion

**Conditional Trade-Off**
- “Would you still support this policy if it resulted in higher taxes for most households?”
  - Yes
  - No
  - Not sure

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Leading or emotionally loaded language.**
  - *Wrong:* “Do you support protecting families by…”
  - *Correct:* Neutral, descriptive phrasing.
- **Burying the lede with early priming.**
  - Context-heavy intros bias responses.
- **Over-interpreting small subgroup results.**
  - Sample size constraints matter.
- **Ignoring non-attitudes.**
  - “Don’t know” is a real and meaningful response.
- **Changing wording mid-trend.**
  - Breaks comparability.
- **Reporting toplines without method.**
  - Undermines credibility.

## Analysis & Output Requirements
- **Primary outputs typically include:**
  - Population-level opinion estimates
  - Issue salience rankings
  - Trend lines over time
  - Subgroup differences (where sample allows)
- **Always report methodological context:**
  - Field dates
  - Sample size
  - Population definition
  - Mode and weighting
- **Include margin of error or uncertainty ranges.**
  - Overall and for key subgroups where appropriate.
- **Weighting rules must be documented and consistent.**
  - Demographics, geography, past behavior (if applicable).
- **Sample size guidance:**
  - Minimum 1,000 completes for national general population polls
  - Larger samples for fine-grained geographic reporting
- **Avoid causal claims.**
  - Polls measure opinion, not behavior causation.
- **Use cautious language in interpretation.**
  - “Indicates,” “suggests,” not “proves.”

## Integration with Other Methods
- **Social Listening:** Detect emerging issues before polling.
- **Brand & Reputation Tracking:** Contextualize institutional trust.
- **ESG & Sustainability Research:** Assess societal expectations.
- **Campaign Effectiveness:** Evaluate public response to messaging.
- **Qualitative Research:** Explore the “why” behind opinions.
