# Advertising Testing (Ad Testing) Methodology

## Overview

Ad Testing research is used to evaluate the **effectiveness, clarity, and persuasive impact of advertising creative** before launch (pre-test) or after exposure in-market (post-test). The goal is to diagnose whether an ad is likely to **break through, communicate the intended message, and drive brand or behavioral outcomes**.

This methodology prioritizes **controlled exposure, disciplined measurement, and diagnostic clarity**. Surveys must isolate the effect of the advertising stimulus from prior brand bias, demand effects, and respondent rationalization.

---

## Core Principles

- **Exposure before evaluation**  
  Respondents must see the advertising stimulus *before* answering any evaluative questions. Never ask hypothetical or opinion-only questions about unseen creative.

- **Separation of notice, communication, and persuasion**  
  Ad testing must independently measure whether an ad is noticed, understood, and motivating. Do not collapse these constructs.

- **Controlled stimulus presentation**  
  All respondents must experience the creative in a standardized way. Variability in exposure invalidates comparisons.

- **Single-ad focus per evaluation**  
  Each test cell must evaluate one primary execution. Multiple creatives require experimental separation.

- **Diagnostic over vanity metrics**  
  Favor metrics that explain *why* an ad works or fails, not just top-line liking.

- **Context-appropriate measurement**  
  Measures must align to ad format, objective, and funnel stage (e.g., awareness vs. conversion).

## Survey Design Requirements

### Question Structure

Surveys must follow this **mandatory structure**:

1. **Pre-exposure controls (minimal)**
2. **Stimulus exposure**
3. **Immediate reaction**
4. **Attention and notice**
5. **Message communication**
6. **Brand linkage**
7. **Persuasion and impact**
8. **Diagnostics and improvement**
9. **Optional brand lift or norms**
10. **Demographics**

#### Pre-Exposure Controls
- Keep minimal to avoid priming.
- Allowed: category usage, brand familiarity (if required).
- Never ask ad-related expectations before exposure.

#### Stimulus Exposure
- Must be forced exposure.
- Require full playback for video.
- Do not allow skipping unless explicitly testing skippability.

#### Immediate Reaction
- Capture gut response before rationalization.
- Use short scales or open-ended reactions immediately post-exposure.

#### Attention and Notice
- Measure whether the ad was noticed and attended to.
- Distinguish between passive exposure and active attention.

#### Message Communication
- Measure takeaway in respondent’s own words before closed-ended validation.
- Validate intended messages explicitly.

#### Brand Linkage
- Measure correct brand attribution.
- Diagnose confusion or misattribution clearly.

#### Persuasion and Impact
- Align metrics to campaign objectives (e.g., consideration, intent).
- Use controlled, realistic outcome measures.

### Scale Design

- **Attention / Notice**
  - Binary or 3-point scales (e.g., “Did not notice”, “Noticed briefly”, “Paid close attention”).
  - Avoid 5+ point scales for basic notice.

- **Agreement / Impact**
  - Use 5-point Likert scales.
  - Always label all points or at least endpoints and midpoint.
  - Maintain consistent polarity.

- **Liking / Appeal**
  - Use 5-point scales only.
  - Do not use 10-point liking scales; they inflate variance without insight.

- **Intent Measures**
  - Use 5-point likelihood scales.
  - Anchor with realistic behavior (“Very unlikely” to “Very likely”).

- **Consistency Rules**
  - One scale per construct.
  - Do not rotate scale direction within the survey.

### Sample Questions

**Immediate Reaction**
> What was your immediate reaction to this ad?  
> - Very negative  
> - Somewhat negative  
> - Neutral  
> - Somewhat positive  
> - Very positive  

**Message Takeaway (Open-Ended)**
> In your own words, what is the main message this ad is trying to communicate?

**Brand Linkage**
> Which brand do you believe this ad was for?  
> - \[Correct brand]  
> - \[Key competitors]  
> - Another brand  
> - Not sure  

**Persuasion**
> After seeing this ad, how likely are you to consider \[BRAND] the next time you are shopping for \[CATEGORY]?  
> - Very unlikely  
> - Somewhat unlikely  
> - Neither likely nor unlikely  
> - Somewhat likely  
> - Very likely

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Asking opinions without exposure**  
  *Wrong:* “How appealing do you find this ad concept?”  
  *Correct:* Show the finished or test-ready creative before evaluation  
  *Why it matters:* Hypothetical reactions do not predict real response.

- **Combining notice and liking**  
  *Wrong:* “I noticed and liked this ad.”  
  *Correct:* Separate notice (“Did you notice?”) from evaluation (“Did you like?”)  
  *Why it matters:* Ads cannot persuade if they are not noticed.

- **Overloading with metrics**  
  *Wrong:* Measuring 20+ attributes for a single execution  
  *Correct:* Focus on 5–8 diagnostics tied to objectives  
  *Why it matters:* Attribute fatigue reduces data quality and clarity.

- **Priming the message**  
  *Wrong:* Asking closed-ended message agreement before open-ended takeaway  
  *Correct:* Always capture unaided takeaway first  
  *Why it matters:* Priming inflates false communication scores.

- **Ignoring brand misattribution**  
  *Wrong:* Excluding “Not sure” or competitor brands from attribution  
  *Correct:* Allow explicit misattribution and uncertainty  
  *Why it matters:* Strong ads can still fail due to weak branding.

## Analysis & Output Requirements

The survey must enable the following outputs:

- **Attention diagnostics**
  - % noticed vs. ignored
  - Depth of attention among those exposed

- **Communication clarity**
  - Unaided takeaway coding
  - % alignment with intended message
  - Identification of misinterpretations

- **Brand linkage**
  - Correct attribution rate
  - Confusion with competitors
  - Branding strength relative to message strength

- **Persuasion metrics**
  - Lift vs. control or benchmark where applicable
  - Directional impact on consideration or intent

- **Creative diagnostics**
  - Identify elements driving positive and negative reactions
  - Pinpoint reasons for low impact or confusion

- **Sample size guidance**
  - Minimum n=150 per creative for directional read
  - n=250–300 per cell recommended for decision-making
  - Control cells required for lift-based designs

- **Data structure**
  - Open-ended responses must be exportable for coding
  - Experimental cells must be clearly labeled
  - Exposure completion must be validated

## Integration with Other Methods

- **Message Testing**  
  Ad testing builds on message testing by evaluating execution, not just claims or copy. Do not substitute one for the other.

- **Brand Tracking**  
  Post-test ad metrics can be trended alongside brand KPIs to assess in-market impact.

- **A/B or Multivariate Testing**  
  Ad testing can support controlled creative comparisons if cells are balanced and exposure is equivalent.

- **Awareness or Funnel Studies**  
  Ad testing often feeds into awareness, consideration, or intent funnel measurement, but must remain diagnostically focused.
