name: claims-testing
description: |
  Validates specific product claims, benefit statements, and marketing assertions for clarity, credibility, differentiation, and persuasive impact through isolated claim evaluation. Use when testing packaging copy, advertising claims, or website statements before launch to identify which assertions add value versus create skepticism. Each claim must be evaluated independently with mandatory comprehension checks before believability assessment. Not suitable for testing full creative executions, early-stage ideation, or bundled multi-benefit statements.

# Claims Testing Research Methodology

## Overview

Claims Testing research is used to evaluate **specific product claims, benefit statements, or marketing assertions** to determine whether they are **clear, believable, differentiated, and motivating**. It is commonly applied to packaging, advertising, websites, and sales materials before launch or revision.

This methodology prioritizes **claim-level isolation and diagnostic precision**. Surveys must test claims independently of full creative execution to understand which statements add value and which introduce risk.

---

## Core Principles

- **Claim isolation**
  Each claim must be evaluated on its own merits. Do not bundle multiple claims into a single test stimulus.

- **Clarity before persuasion**
  A claim that is not understood cannot be persuasive. Always measure comprehension before appeal or impact.

- **Believability as a gatekeeper**
  Claims must pass a credibility threshold before any persuasion metrics are interpreted.

- **Literal interpretation**
  Respondents evaluate claims as written. Do not assume implied meaning or intended nuance.

- **Neutral presentation**
  Claims must be presented without visual design, tone, or contextual cues unless explicitly testing execution.

- **Risk identification**
  Claims testing must surface skepticism, confusion, or backlash risk—not just upside.

## Survey Design Requirements

### Question Structure

Surveys must follow this **mandatory structure for each claim**:

1. **Claim exposure**
2. **Comprehension**
3. **Clarity**
4. **Believability**
5. **Differentiation**
6. **Relevance**
7. **Persuasive impact**
8. **Concerns or skepticism**
9. **Comparative prioritization (if applicable)**

#### Claim Exposure
- Present claims **verbatim**, exactly as intended for market use.
- Display one claim at a time.
- Do not explain or paraphrase claims before evaluation.

#### Comprehension
- Capture understanding in the respondent’s own words first.
- Use open-ended questions before any closed-ended validation.

#### Clarity
- Measure whether the claim is easy to understand.
- Distinguish clarity from agreement or liking.

#### Believability
- Ask explicitly whether the claim is credible.
- Include skepticism measures where risk is high.

#### Differentiation
- Assess whether the claim stands out versus competitors.
- Do not assume respondents know competitive landscapes unless validated.

### Scale Design

- **Clarity**
  - Use 5-point clarity scales.
  - Anchors: “Very unclear” to “Very clear”.

- **Believability**
  - Use 5-point believability scales.
  - Anchors: “Not at all believable” to “Completely believable”.

- **Relevance**
  - Use 5-point relevance or importance scales.
  - Tie relevance explicitly to category need.

- **Persuasion**
  - Use 5-point likelihood or agreement scales.
  - Anchor to realistic outcomes (e.g., consideration).

- **Consistency rules**
  - One scale type per construct.
  - Maintain identical scales across claims for comparability.

### Sample Questions

**Claim Exposure**
> *“Provides noticeable results in just 7 days.”*

**Comprehension (Open-Ended)**
> In your own words, what do you believe this statement is saying?

**Believability**
> How believable do you find this statement?  
> - Not at all believable  
> - Slightly believable  
> - Moderately believable  
> - Very believable  
> - Completely believable  

**Persuasive Impact**
> How much does this statement increase your interest in trying this product?  
> - Not at all  
> - A little  
> - Somewhat  
> - Quite a bit  
> - A great deal

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Testing multiple ideas at once**
  *Wrong:* “Fast, affordable, and clinically proven results.”  
  *Correct:* Test each benefit as a separate claim  
  *Why it matters:* Multi-idea claims cannot be diagnosed.

- **Skipping comprehension**
  *Wrong:* Asking believability without confirming understanding  
  *Correct:* Always verify what respondents think the claim means  
  *Why it matters:* High believability of a misinterpreted claim is misleading.

- **Leading respondents**
  *Wrong:* “This claim sounds impressive.”  
  *Correct:* Neutral wording focused on clarity and credibility  
  *Why it matters:* Leading language inflates scores artificially.

- **Ignoring skepticism**
  *Wrong:* Omitting concern or doubt measures  
  *Correct:* Explicitly capture reasons for disbelief  
  *Why it matters:* Claims can damage trust if they feel exaggerated.

- **Testing claims in finished ads**
  *Wrong:* Evaluating claims only within full creative  
  *Correct:* Isolate claims first, then test execution separately  
  *Why it matters:* Creative can mask weak claims.

## Analysis & Output Requirements

The survey must enable the following analyses:

- **Claim comprehension**
  - % correctly understood
  - Common misinterpretations

- **Credibility screening**
  - Believability distribution
  - Identification of over-claiming risk

- **Value contribution**
  - Relevance and differentiation scores
  - Incremental persuasion vs. baseline

- **Risk diagnostics**
  - Sources of skepticism or concern
  - Potential trust erosion indicators

- **Claim prioritization**
  - Rank claims by clarity × believability × impact
  - Identify “must-use”, “nice-to-have”, and “avoid” claims

- **Sample size guidance**
  - Minimum n=100–150 per claim for directional reads
  - n=250+ recommended for high-stakes claims
  - Rotate claims to manage respondent burden

- **Data structure**
  - One record per respondent per claim
  - Clear claim identifiers
  - Open-ended responses linked to claim IDs

---

## Integration with Other Methods

- **Message Testing**
  Claims testing feeds message testing by identifying the strongest building blocks.

- **Ad Testing**
  High-performing claims should be embedded and re-evaluated in executional context.

- **Pack Testing**
  Claims testing informs which statements deserve front-of-pack emphasis.

- **Legal or Regulatory Review**
  Claims testing highlights consumer interpretation risks that may require legal mitigation.
