description: |
  Maps and measures how shoppers move from initial trigger to purchase across channels and touchpoints, identifying conversion drivers and drop-off points. Use when purchase decisions unfold across multiple steps, platforms, or retail environments where conversion loss occurs between intent and transaction. Focuses on behavioral sequence and decision logic rather than post-hoc rationalization to optimize conversion interventions. Commonly combined with segmentation to identify different path archetypes and media measurement to understand touchpoint effectiveness.

# Shopper Path-to-Purchase Research (Decision Flow & Conversion Drivers)

## Overview
Shopper Path-to-Purchase Research is a methodology used to **understand how shoppers actually move from initial trigger to purchase**, including the channels, touchpoints, decision rules, and frictions encountered along the way. It is applied in categories where purchase decisions unfold across **multiple steps, platforms, or retail environments**, and where conversion loss occurs between intent and transaction.

This methodology focuses on **behavioral sequence and decision logic**, not post-hoc rationalization, enabling organizations to identify where shoppers drop out, what accelerates conversion, and which interventions matter most.

## Core Principles
- **Paths are non-linear.** Shoppers loop, pause, and switch channels; designs must capture this reality.
- **Behavior over recall.** Measure actions taken, not what shoppers think they should have done.
- **Moments decide outcomes.** Specific triggers, barriers, and reassurances determine progression.
- **Channel ≠ touchpoint.** The same channel can serve different roles at different stages.
- **Drop-off is diagnostic.** Where shoppers exit reveals fixable conversion issues.
- **Granularity enables optimization.** High-level funnels are insufficient for action.

## Survey Design Requirements

### Question Structure
- **Explicitly qualify recent shoppers.**
  - Respondents must have completed or abandoned a purchase within a defined recall window (typically 30–90 days).
- **Anchor all questions to a specific purchase occasion.**
  - Category, brand, retailer, and timeframe must be fixed.
- **Use a staged reconstruction approach:**
  1. Trigger or need recognition
  2. Initial consideration set
  3. Information search and evaluation
  4. Comparison and shortlisting
  5. Purchase decision
  6. Purchase channel and execution
  7. Post-purchase validation (optional)
- **Capture sequence explicitly.**
  - Ask what happened first, next, and last.
- **Allow branching paths.**
  - Different questions for online vs in-store, planned vs impulse, repeat vs new.
- **Include abandonment logic.**
  - Shoppers who did not purchase must be routed to exit diagnostics.
- **Separate path mapping from evaluation.**
  - First capture what happened; then diagnose why.

### Scale Design
- **Path mapping uses categorical and sequence data.**
  - Avoid rating scales for behavioral steps.
- **Use 5-point scales for friction and confidence diagnostics.**
  - Example: “Not at all confident” → “Extremely confident”
- **Barrier and trigger importance should use forced prioritization.**
  - Ranking or allocation, not agreement.
- **Maintain consistent scales across stages** to enable comparison.
- **Avoid satisfaction scales as primary measures.**
  - Satisfaction does not explain conversion.

### Sample Questions
**Occasion Anchor**
- “Thinking about the last time you shopped for [category], which of the following best describes what happened?”
  - Purchased
  - Considered but did not purchase

**Trigger Identification**
- “What initially prompted you to start shopping for this product?”
  - Ran out / needed replacement
  - Saw an ad or promotion
  - Recommendation
  - Browsing / impulse
  - Other (specify)

**Sequence Mapping**
- “Which of the following did you do, and in what order?”
  - Searched online
  - Visited a store
  - Compared prices
  - Read reviews
  - Asked someone for advice
  - Made a purchase

**Channel Role**
- “At which stage did each of the following play a role?”
  - Discovery
  - Evaluation
  - Final purchase

**Abandonment Diagnostic**
- “What was the main reason you did not complete a purchase at that time?”
  - Price
  - Uncertainty
  - Availability
  - Time / effort
  - Chose another category
  - Other (specify)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Using generic funnels.**
  - *Wrong:* Awareness → Consideration → Purchase only.
  - *Correct:* Behaviorally grounded step-by-step paths.
- **Allowing vague recall.**
  - Always anchor to a specific occasion.
- **Over-simplifying channels.**
  - Online and offline roles overlap and change.
- **Ignoring non-buyers.**
  - Abandonment insights are often more valuable than completion.
- **Asking “why” before “what.”**
  - Explanations without behavior are unreliable.
- **Collapsing different shopper types.**
  - New vs repeat shoppers follow different paths.

## Analysis & Output Requirements
- **Primary outputs typically include:**
  - Path archetypes (common sequences)
  - Drop-off points by stage
  - Channel contribution by stage
  - Trigger and barrier importance
  - Conversion and abandonment rates
- **Analyze paths, not just stages.**
  - Identify the most common sequences end-to-end.
- **Segment path analysis is mandatory.**
  - New vs repeat
  - High vs low spend
  - Online-first vs store-first
- **Sample size guidance:**
  - Minimum 400–600 qualified shoppers
  - Ensure sufficient non-purchaser sample
- **Avoid averaging path data.**
  - Use flow diagrams or Sankey-style summaries.
- **Translate findings into interventions.**
  - Content needs
  - Channel optimization
  - Promotion timing
  - Friction removal

## Integration with Other Methods
- **Shopper Segmentation:** Different segments follow different paths.
- **Media Attention Measurement:** Understand which touchpoints capture attention.
- **Campaign Effectiveness:** Link media exposure to path acceleration.
- **Pricing Studies:** Diagnose price sensitivity moments.
- **In-Store or UX Research:** Deepen understanding of key friction points.
