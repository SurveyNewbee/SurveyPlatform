# Employer Brand Research (Employer Value Proposition & Talent Perception)

## Overview
Employer Brand Research is a methodology used to **understand how current and prospective employees perceive an organization as a place to work**, and to define or validate a clear Employer Value Proposition (EVP). It is applied to improve attraction, engagement, and retention by aligning the employment promise with lived experience and competitive reality.

This methodology focuses on **truth, differentiation, and fit**, not aspiration alone. A credible employer brand attracts the right talent and repels poor-fit candidates.

## Core Principles
- **Truth over aspiration.** The EVP must reflect real experience, not desired image.
- **Fit beats broad appeal.** Strong employer brands deliberately exclude as much as they include.
- **Experience validates promise.** Internal reality must substantiate external messaging.
- **Differentiation requires trade-offs.** Generic “great place to work” claims fail.
- **Segment talent markets.** What attracts early-career talent may repel senior specialists.
- **Employer brand is longitudinal.** Perceptions evolve with experience and market signals.

## Survey Design Requirements

### Question Structure
- **Explicitly separate internal and external audiences.**
  - Current employees
  - Former employees (recent exits)
  - Prospective candidates / target talent
- **Anchor all evaluations to a specific employer.**
  - Avoid category-level abstraction.
- **Use a staged structure:**
  1. Awareness and familiarity (external)
  2. Perceived EVP components
  3. Credibility and distinctiveness
  4. Personal fit and appeal
  5. Experience validation (internal)
  6. Advocacy and intent (apply, stay, recommend)
- **Test EVP statements as complete promises.**
  - Each statement must include:
    - What is offered
    - For whom
    - Why it is distinctive
- **Use monadic or sequential monadic exposure for EVP options.**
  - Avoid side-by-side early testing.
- **Include open-ended interpretation checks.**
  - Ensure intended meaning is understood.
- **For employees, include tenure and role context.**
  - Experience varies materially by level and function.

### Scale Design
- **Use 5-point agreement or fit scales.**
  - Example: “Strongly disagree” → “Strongly agree”
- **Measure distinctiveness explicitly.**
  - Example: “Common among employers” → “Highly distinctive”
- **Maintain identical scales across audiences** where questions overlap.
- **Avoid satisfaction-only measures.**
  - Satisfaction does not equal employer brand strength.
- **Include a clear “not credible” option.**
  - Forced agreement invalidates EVP testing.

### Sample Questions
**EVP Comprehension**
- “How clear is what this employer would offer you as a place to work?”
  - 1 = Not at all clear
  - 5 = Extremely clear

**EVP Credibility**
- “How believable is it that this organization could genuinely deliver on this promise?”
  - 1 = Not at all believable
  - 5 = Extremely believable

**Distinctiveness**
- “How different is this from what other employers offer?”
  - 1 = Not at all different
  - 5 = Extremely different

**Fit and Appeal**
- “How well does this employer match what you personally look for in a job?”
  - 1 = Not at all well
  - 5 = Extremely well

**Experience Validation (Employees)**
- “Based on your experience, how true is this statement about working here?”
  - 1 = Not at all true
  - 5 = Completely true

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Confusing employer brand with culture statements.**
  - *Wrong:* Internal values without candidate relevance.
  - *Correct:* Clear exchange of value for work.
- **Over-indexing on pride or engagement.**
  - Pride does not equal attraction.
- **Testing benefits lists instead of propositions.**
  - EVP must integrate benefits into meaning.
- **Ignoring former employees.**
  - Exits often reveal credibility gaps.
- **Assuming one EVP fits all roles.**
  - Segment-level nuance is often required.
- **Letting marketing language obscure reality.**
  - Flowery language reduces credibility.

## Analysis & Output Requirements
- **Primary evaluation dimensions:**
  - Clarity of EVP
  - Credibility vs experience
  - Differentiation vs competitors
  - Segment-level fit
  - Attraction and retention signals
- **Analyze gaps explicitly:**
  - External promise vs internal reality
  - Leadership intent vs employee experience
- **Key outputs typically include:**
  - EVP performance dashboard
  - Segment-specific appeal profiles
  - Credibility gap analysis
  - Talent attraction and retention implications
- **Sample size guidance:**
  - External talent: 200–400 per priority segment
  - Employees: Census preferred; minimum 300 for segmentation
- **Segment analysis is mandatory.**
  - Role families, seniority, geography
- **Deliver clear recommendations:**
  - EVP to adopt or refine
  - Messages to amplify or retire
  - Experience gaps to close

## Integration with Other Methods
- **Employee Engagement:** Validate EVP delivery internally.
- **Culture Change Research:** Ensure EVP aligns with desired behaviors.
- **DEI Research:** Assess inclusivity and belonging claims.
- **Employer Brand Tracking:** Monitor EVP strength over time.
- **Recruitment Funnel Analysis:** Link EVP to applicant quality and conversion.
