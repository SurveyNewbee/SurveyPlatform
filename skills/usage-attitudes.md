# Usage & Attitudes (U&A) Research Methodology

## Overview

Usage & Attitudes research is the **foundational category study** that maps how a market works — who buys what, how often, where, why, and what they think about it. It produces the **behavioural and attitudinal baseline** that informs brand strategy, innovation, competitive positioning, and segmentation.

A well-executed U&A study answers: What is the category landscape? How do consumers behave within it? What are their attitudes and beliefs? Where are the unmet needs? How does our brand fit within this ecosystem?

---

## Core Principles

- **Behaviour first, attitudes second**
  Start with what people actually do (buy, use, consume), then explore why. Attitudes without behavioural anchoring are unreliable.

- **Exhaustive brand and product coverage**
  A U&A study must capture the FULL competitive landscape — every brand, product form, channel, and occasion that matters. Incomplete coverage creates blind spots.

- **Consistent recall periods**
  All behavioural questions must use the same time window (typically "past 3 months" or "past 6 months"). Mixing recall periods makes data incomparable.

- **Occasion and context specificity**
  "When" and "why" matter as much as "what." The same consumer may use different brands for different occasions. Map the full occasion landscape.

- **Attitudinal batteries must be actionable**
  Include only attitude statements that can plausibly drive strategic decisions. Generic statements ("I like quality") waste survey time. Statements should differentiate segments or predict behaviour.

- **Segmentation-ready design**
  U&A data frequently feeds segmentation analysis. Ensure attitude batteries, need states, and behavioural variables are designed to produce clean, interpretable segments.

- **Allow for non-participation**
  Not every respondent uses every product form or occasion. Build in "Not applicable" and "None of these" options. Don't force responses where behaviour doesn't exist.

- **Benchmark over time**
  U&A studies are most valuable when repeated (annually or biannually) to track shifts. Design for comparability from Wave 1.

## Survey Design Requirements

### Question Structure

Surveys must follow this **mandatory U&A sequence**:

1. **Category screening and qualification**
2. **Category usage behaviour**
3. **Brand awareness and usage**
4. **Brand repertoire and loyalty**
5. **Purchase behaviour and channels**
6. **Occasion and need-state mapping**
7. **Satisfaction and experience**
8. **Attitudes and beliefs battery**
9. **Unmet needs and innovation inputs**
10. **Demographics**

---

### Section 1: Category Screening and Qualification

Define the relevant population and confirm category participation.

```
1. Which of the following product categories do you personally purchase or use?
   Select all that apply.
   - [CATEGORY A]
   - [CATEGORY B — the target category]
   - [CATEGORY C]
   - [CATEGORY D]
   - None of these [TERMINATE]

2. How often do you purchase or use [TARGET CATEGORY] products?
   - Daily or almost daily
   - Several times a week
   - About once a week
   - 2-3 times a month
   - About once a month
   - Every 2-3 months
   - Every 4-6 months
   - Less than every 6 months
   - I have used [CATEGORY] in the past but not in the last 12 months [CONTINUE — lapsed users]
   - I have never used [CATEGORY] [TERMINATE or route to non-user module]
```

**Why screening includes other categories:** Embedding the target category among others reduces self-selection bias and demand characteristics (respondents don't know which category you care about).

---

### Section 2: Category Usage Behaviour

Map how respondents interact with the category at a behavioural level.

```
1. In the past [RECALL PERIOD], how often have you purchased [CATEGORY] products?
   [Frequency scale matching screening question]

2. In a typical [WEEK/MONTH], how many times do you use [CATEGORY] products?
   - Once
   - 2-3 times
   - 4-5 times
   - 6-10 times
   - More than 10 times
   [Calibrate options to realistic usage patterns for the category]

3. Which types/forms of [CATEGORY] products do you use? Select all that apply.
   - [Product Form A — e.g., liquid, powder, capsule]
   - [Product Form B]
   - [Product Form C]
   - [Product Form D]
   - Other (please specify)

4. Which size(s) of [CATEGORY] products do you typically purchase? Select all that apply.
   - [Size A — e.g., single serve, travel size]
   - [Size B — e.g., standard, regular]
   - [Size C — e.g., family, bulk]
   - Other / varies

5. Approximately how much do you spend on [CATEGORY] products in a typical [MONTH/QUARTER]?
   - Less than $[X]
   - $[X] - $[Y]
   - $[Y] - $[Z]
   - More than $[Z]
   - Not sure
```

---

### Section 3: Brand Awareness and Usage

Map the full competitive landscape from awareness through to regular usage.

```
1. Which of the following [CATEGORY] brands are you aware of? Select all that apply.
   [Comprehensive brand list — RANDOMISED ORDER]
   - [Brand A]
   - [Brand B]
   - [Brand C]
   ... [Full list]
   - Other (please specify)
   - I'm not aware of any specific brands

2. Which of these brands have you EVER purchased or used? Select all that apply.
   [PIPE IN: Brands selected in awareness Q]

3. Which of these brands have you purchased or used in the PAST [RECALL PERIOD]? Select all that apply.
   [PIPE IN: Brands selected in ever-used Q]

4. Which ONE brand do you use MOST OFTEN?
   [PIPE IN: Brands selected in recent usage Q]
   ○ I don't have a brand I use most often — I switch frequently

5. Which brand(s) would you consider purchasing next time? Select all that apply.
   [PIPE IN: All brands from awareness Q]
   - I would consider any brand / no preference
```

**Why this funnel matters:** This constructs the classic awareness → trial → recent usage → regular usage → loyalty funnel. Each level enables different analysis: total awareness, trial rate, repeat rate, share of requirements, competitive consideration set.

---

### Section 4: Brand Repertoire and Loyalty

Understand switching behaviour and brand relationship depth.

```
1. How would you describe your approach to choosing [CATEGORY] brands?
   - I almost always buy the same brand
   - I usually buy the same brand but occasionally try others
   - I rotate between 2-3 brands I like
   - I choose whatever seems best at the time — no strong brand preference
   - I'm always looking to try new brands

2. [IF HAS A MOST-USED BRAND] How long have you been using [MOST-USED BRAND]?
   - Less than 3 months
   - 3-6 months
   - 6 months to 1 year
   - 1-2 years
   - 2-5 years
   - More than 5 years

3. [IF HAS A MOST-USED BRAND] How likely are you to continue using [MOST-USED BRAND] as your primary brand over the next 12 months?
   - Extremely likely — I have no intention of changing
   - Very likely
   - Somewhat likely
   - Not very likely
   - Not at all likely — I'm actively looking for alternatives

4. [IF NOT VERY/NOT AT ALL LIKELY] What is driving you to consider changing? Select all that apply.
   - Price has increased
   - Quality has declined
   - Want to try something new
   - Heard good things about another brand
   - Product availability issues
   - Change in personal needs or preferences
   - Other (please specify)
```

---

### Section 5: Purchase Behaviour and Channels

Map where and how purchasing happens.

```
1. Where do you typically purchase [CATEGORY] products? Select all that apply.
   - [Channel A — e.g., Supermarket/grocery store]
   - [Channel B — e.g., Pharmacy/drugstore]
   - [Channel C — e.g., Specialty retailer]
   - [Channel D — e.g., Online — brand website]
   - [Channel E — e.g., Online — Amazon/marketplace]
   - [Channel F — e.g., Subscription service]
   - Other (please specify)

2. Which ONE channel do you use MOST for purchasing [CATEGORY]?
   [PIPE IN: Channels selected above]

3. When purchasing [CATEGORY], how much does each of the following influence your decision? 

   [Matrix: Influence factors × 5-point importance scale]
   
   Factors (randomise):
   - Price / value for money
   - Brand reputation
   - Product reviews / ratings
   - Recommendation from friends/family
   - Ingredients / formulation
   - Packaging / design
   - Sustainability / environmental claims
   - Promotional offers / discounts
   - [Category-specific factors]
   
   Scale: Extremely influential → Not at all influential

4. How do you typically decide which [CATEGORY] product to buy?
   - I know exactly what I want before I go shopping
   - I have a shortlist but decide at the shelf/site
   - I browse and decide in the moment
   - I buy whatever is on promotion / best value
   - It varies depending on the situation
```

---

### Section 6: Occasion and Need-State Mapping

Map when, where, and why the category is used. This is critical for positioning and innovation.

```
1. In which of the following situations do you typically use [CATEGORY] products? Select all that apply.
   - [Occasion A — e.g., Morning routine]
   - [Occasion B — e.g., Before going out]
   - [Occasion C — e.g., After exercise]
   - [Occasion D — e.g., When skin feels dry/irritated]
   - [Occasion E — e.g., Seasonal change]
   - Other (please specify)
   [Occasions must be specific to the category]

2. Which ONE occasion is MOST important to you — where you are most particular about which [CATEGORY] product you use?
   [PIPE IN: Occasions selected above]

3. What are you primarily trying to achieve when you use [CATEGORY] products? Select your top 3.
   - [Need State A — e.g., Hydration / moisture]
   - [Need State B — e.g., Anti-ageing / wrinkle reduction]
   - [Need State C — e.g., Brightening / even skin tone]
   - [Need State D — e.g., Acne control / blemish reduction]
   - [Need State E — e.g., Sun protection]
   - [Need State F — e.g., General maintenance / looking healthy]
   - Other (please specify)
   [Need states must reflect actual category benefits, not brand promises]

4. Do you use different brands or products for different occasions or needs?
   - Yes, I use different products for different occasions
   - No, I use the same product(s) regardless of occasion
   - Sometimes — it depends
```

**Why occasion mapping matters:** Occasions are the entry point for brand positioning and innovation. A brand that "owns" the morning routine occasion has a different strategy than one targeting post-exercise recovery. This data enables occasion-based segmentation and white-space identification.

---

### Section 7: Satisfaction and Experience

Measure satisfaction with current products and identify gaps.

```
1. Overall, how satisfied are you with the [CATEGORY] products currently available?
   - Extremely satisfied
   - Very satisfied
   - Somewhat satisfied
   - Not very satisfied
   - Not at all satisfied

2. [IF HAS A MOST-USED BRAND] How satisfied are you with [MOST-USED BRAND] on each of the following?

   [Matrix: Attributes × 5-point satisfaction scale]
   
   Attributes (randomise):
   - Overall quality
   - Value for money
   - Effectiveness / results
   - Ease of use
   - Packaging / design
   - Range of options
   - Availability / easy to find
   - [Category-specific attributes]
   
   Scale: Extremely satisfied → Not at all satisfied
   Include: "Not applicable / Can't say" option per row

3. What, if anything, frustrates you about [CATEGORY] products currently available?
   [Open text — 1-2 sentences]
```

---

### Section 8: Attitudes and Beliefs Battery

Measure category-relevant attitudes that differentiate consumers and predict behaviour. These feed directly into attitudinal segmentation.

```
How much do you agree or disagree with each of the following statements about [CATEGORY]?

[Matrix: Statements × 5-point agreement scale]

Scale: Strongly agree → Strongly disagree
Include: "Neither agree nor disagree" midpoint

Statements (randomise — select 12-18 relevant to the category):

[Quality / Premium orientation]
- I'm willing to pay more for higher quality [CATEGORY] products
- I believe you get what you pay for with [CATEGORY]
- I prefer premium/luxury brands over mass-market options

[Price sensitivity]
- Price is the most important factor when choosing [CATEGORY]
- I always look for deals or promotions before buying [CATEGORY]
- I'd switch brands for a better price

[Innovation / Exploration]
- I enjoy trying new [CATEGORY] products and brands
- I'm usually among the first to try new products in this category
- I prefer to stick with what I know rather than experiment

[Ingredient / Formulation focus]
- I carefully read ingredient lists before purchasing
- Natural/organic ingredients are important to me in [CATEGORY]
- I research [CATEGORY] products thoroughly before buying

[Brand relationship]
- I feel loyal to my current [CATEGORY] brand
- Brand reputation matters a lot to me in this category
- I trust recommendations from friends/family more than brand advertising

[Sustainability / Ethics]
- I consider the environmental impact when choosing [CATEGORY]
- I'm willing to pay more for sustainable/eco-friendly options
- A brand's social responsibility influences my purchase decisions

[Category engagement]
- [CATEGORY] is an important part of my daily routine
- I spend a lot of time thinking about which [CATEGORY] products to buy
- [CATEGORY] is something I enjoy spending money on
```

**Design rules for attitude batteries:**
- **12-18 statements maximum** — beyond 18, fatigue degrades response quality
- Every statement must plausibly differentiate between consumers (avoid universal truths like "I want products that work")
- Balance positive and negative framing to avoid acquiescence bias
- Include statements that map to 3-5 underlying attitudinal dimensions (for factor analysis / segmentation)
- Test the battery with a small pilot or expert review before fielding
- Randomise statement order to prevent primacy/recency effects

---

### Section 9: Unmet Needs and Innovation Inputs

Identify gaps in current category offerings that represent opportunities.

```
1. Thinking about [CATEGORY] products, what is the ONE thing you wish was available that currently isn't?
   [Open text — 1-2 sentences]

2. Which of the following features or improvements would make you more likely to try a new [CATEGORY] product? Select up to 3.
   - [Feature/Improvement A]
   - [Feature/Improvement B]
   - [Feature/Improvement C]
   - [Feature/Improvement D]
   - [Feature/Improvement E]
   - [Feature/Improvement F]
   - None of these — I'm satisfied with current options
   [Features should reflect realistic innovation territories, not fantasy features]

3. How likely would you be to switch to a new [CATEGORY] brand if it offered [KEY INNOVATION/BENEFIT]?
   - Extremely likely
   - Very likely
   - Somewhat likely
   - Not very likely
   - Not at all likely
```

---

## Scale Design

- **Frequency:** Ordered frequency bands, calibrated to category purchase/usage cycles. Match recall windows across all frequency questions.
- **Awareness/Usage funnel:** Sequential filtering — awareness → ever used → recent usage → most used → consideration. Always pipe forward (don't re-show brands not selected at previous level).
- **Satisfaction:** 5-point scale, "Extremely satisfied" to "Not at all satisfied." Include "N/A" for attribute satisfaction matrices.
- **Importance/Influence:** 5-point scale, "Extremely important/influential" to "Not at all important/influential."
- **Agreement (attitudes):** 5-point Likert with midpoint, "Strongly agree" to "Strongly disagree."
- **Purchase influence:** 5-point importance/influence scale in matrix format.
- **Open-ends:** Include at least 2 open-end questions (frustrations + unmet needs) for qualitative richness.

**Consistency rules:**
- All recall periods must match (if "past 3 months" for usage, use "past 3 months" for purchase too)
- Brand lists must be identical across awareness, usage, and consideration questions (with piping to filter)
- Randomise brand order, attribute order, and attitude statement order
- Do NOT randomise scale direction (always positive-to-negative, consistently)
- Include "Other (please specify)" on all brand and channel lists

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Incomplete brand lists**
  *Wrong:* Including only top 5 brands
  *Correct:* Include ALL brands with >1% market share, plus "Other" with specify
  *Why it matters:* Missing brands creates blind spots in competitive analysis and artificially inflates share of listed brands

- **Inconsistent recall periods**
  *Wrong:* "Used in past month" for frequency but "purchased in past 6 months" for brands
  *Correct:* Same recall period for all behavioural questions
  *Why it matters:* Inconsistent timeframes make cross-tabulation unreliable

- **Generic attitude statements**
  *Wrong:* "I like products that work well"
  *Correct:* "I'm willing to pay more for higher quality [CATEGORY] products"
  *Why it matters:* Generic statements produce unanimous agreement and don't differentiate segments

- **Too many attitude statements**
  *Wrong:* 30+ Likert-scale statements
  *Correct:* 12-18 maximum, each with a clear strategic purpose
  *Why it matters:* Fatigue causes straight-lining (selecting the same response for all items)

- **Missing occasion context**
  *Wrong:* Asking about usage without "when" and "why"
  *Correct:* Map occasions, need states, and brand-by-occasion connections
  *Why it matters:* Usage without occasion context misses positioning and innovation opportunities

- **No open-ends**
  *Wrong:* Entirely closed-ended survey
  *Correct:* Include at least frustrations + unmet needs as open-ends
  *Why it matters:* Closed-ended questions measure known dimensions; open-ends reveal unknown dimensions

- **Forcing responses where behaviour doesn't exist**
  *Wrong:* Requiring a "most used brand" from someone who said they switch frequently
  *Correct:* Include "I don't have a brand I use most often" option
  *Why it matters:* Forced responses on non-existent behaviour produce noise

## Analysis & Output Requirements

### Brand Funnel Analysis

For each brand, calculate and visualise:

```
Brand A:
  Total Awareness:     85%
  Ever Used:           62%
  Recent Usage (3mo):  41%
  Most Often Used:     22%
  Consideration:       48%

Conversion Ratios:
  Awareness → Trial:       73%  (62/85)
  Trial → Recent Usage:    66%  (41/62)
  Recent → Regular:        54%  (22/41)
  Awareness → Consideration: 56%  (48/85)
```

**Funnel comparison chart:** Side-by-side funnel charts for all major brands, highlighting where each brand gains or loses vs competitors.

### Usage Landscape

- Category usage frequency distribution
- Product form penetration (% using each form)
- Size preference distribution
- Spend distribution (by frequency band)
- Category growth indicators (new users, lapsed users, frequency changes)

### Occasion Map

- Occasion penetration (% using category for each occasion)
- Brand-by-occasion matrix (which brands are used for which occasions)
- Need-state prioritisation (ranked needs)
- Occasion-based white space (occasions where no brand dominates)

### Satisfaction Analysis

- Overall category satisfaction distribution
- Brand-level satisfaction comparison
- Attribute-level satisfaction by brand (radar/spider chart)
- Importance vs Satisfaction gap analysis (quadrant chart):
  - High importance + Low satisfaction = **Priority improvement areas**
  - High importance + High satisfaction = **Maintain**
  - Low importance + Low satisfaction = **Low priority**
  - Low importance + High satisfaction = **Potential over-investment**

### Attitudinal Segmentation Inputs

- Factor analysis on attitude battery to identify underlying dimensions
- Cluster analysis to identify attitudinal segments (typically 3-6 segments)
- Segment profiling on demographics, behaviour, brand usage, and attitudes
- Segment sizing (% of population in each segment)

### Competitive Positioning Map

- Brand attribute perception ratings (from satisfaction or importance matrix)
- Perceptual map (2D plot from correspondence analysis or PCA on brand attributes)
- Competitive strengths and vulnerabilities per brand

### Unmet Needs Summary

- Coded open-end themes from frustration and wish-list questions
- Feature/innovation priority ranking from closed-ended question
- Switching intent for key innovation territories
- Gap opportunities by segment

---

## Integration with Other Methods

- **Market Sizing:** U&A provides the behavioural foundation (incidence, frequency, spend) that market sizing builds on. Can be conducted as an integrated study.
- **Segmentation:** U&A attitude batteries and behavioural data are the primary inputs for segmentation analysis. Design them together.
- **Competitive Positioning:** U&A brand perception data feeds directly into perceptual mapping and competitive strategy.
- **Brand Tracking:** U&A Wave 1 establishes the baseline that brand tracking monitors over time.
- **Concept Testing:** U&A identifies unmet needs and occasion gaps that concept testing validates.
- **Pricing:** U&A spend data and price sensitivity attitudes provide context for dedicated pricing research.

## Final Guidance

A U&A study is the most comprehensive and foundational piece of category research a brand can commission. Its value comes from breadth and depth working together — behavioural specificity combined with attitudinal richness.

Key principles for maximum impact:

1. **Start with behaviour, end with attitudes.** Behaviour is observable and reliable. Attitudes explain behaviour and predict future behaviour. The sequence matters.
2. **Be exhaustive where it counts.** Brand lists, occasion lists, and channel lists must be comprehensive. One missing brand or occasion creates a strategic blind spot.
3. **Design for segmentation from the start.** If you think you might want segments later, build the attitude battery and behavioural variables for segmentation now. Retrofitting is impossible.
4. **Plan for tracking.** A U&A study becomes exponentially more valuable when repeated. Design Wave 1 with Wave 2+ in mind — consistent question wording, consistent brand lists, consistent recall periods.
5. **Use open-ends for innovation.** The most valuable innovation insights often come from the frustration and unmet needs open-ends. Don't skip them or bury them.

**Remember:** A U&A study succeeds when everyone in the organisation — from brand managers to innovation teams to sales — can point to a specific finding that changed a decision.
