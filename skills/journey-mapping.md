name: journey-mapping
description: |
  Maps end-to-end customer experiences by reconstructing chronological stages, touchpoints, needs, emotions, and pain points from trigger through post-use outcomes. Use when diagnosing experience breakdowns across multi-stage processes like purchasing, onboarding, or service delivery. Requires recent, completed journeys (typically 30-90 days) and structures questions stage-by-stage rather than globally. Commonly combined with usability-testing (focus problem areas) or nps-csat (explain satisfaction drivers). Not suitable for single-touchpoint interactions, brand perception studies, or hypothetical future experiences.

# Customer Journey Mapping Research Methodology

## Overview

Customer Journey Mapping research is used to systematically document the **end-to-end experience customers have with a category, brand, or service**, from initial trigger through post-use outcomes. The objective is to identify **key stages, touchpoints, needs, emotions, friction points, and moments of truth** that drive satisfaction, choice, or defection.

This methodology prioritizes **temporal accuracy and experiential sequencing**. Surveys must reconstruct real journeys as they occurred, not idealized or hypothetical paths.

---

## Core Principles

- **Chronological reconstruction**
  Always structure the journey in time order. Respondents must recall experiences step by step, not as an undifferentiated whole.

- **Stage discipline**
  Journey stages must be clearly defined, mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive. Overlapping stages undermine diagnostic clarity.

- **Experience over opinion**
  Measure what respondents experienced at each stage before asking how they felt about it.

- **Touchpoint specificity**
  Capture concrete interactions (channels, moments, interfaces), not abstract perceptions.

- **Emotion as a diagnostic layer**
  Emotions explain impact but do not replace functional performance measures.

- **Behaviorally anchored recall**
  Anchor questions to real actions, decisions, or events to reduce recall bias.

## Survey Design Requirements

### Question Structure

Surveys must follow this **mandatory structure**:

1. **Journey qualification**
2. **Journey stage confirmation**
3. **Stage-by-stage reconstruction**
4. **Touchpoint identification**
5. **Needs and expectations by stage**
6. **Pain points and friction**
7. **Emotional experience**
8. **Moments of truth**
9. **Overall evaluation and outcomes**
10. **Demographics**

#### Journey Qualification
- Qualify respondents based on **recent, completed journeys**.
- Define a strict recall window (typically past 30–90 days).
- Disqualify respondents with incomplete or hypothetical journeys unless explicitly studying drop-off.

#### Journey Stage Confirmation
- Present a **clear, fixed set of stages**.
- Confirm which stages the respondent personally experienced.
- Route respondents only through relevant stages.

#### Stage-by-Stage Reconstruction
- Ask questions **one stage at a time**, in sequence.
- Never allow respondents to answer globally across stages.
- Use consistent question blocks for each stage.

#### Touchpoint Identification
- Capture all channels or interactions used at each stage.
- Allow multi-select where appropriate.
- Distinguish between brand-owned, partner, and third-party touchpoints.

#### Needs and Expectations
- Measure what respondents were trying to accomplish at each stage.
- Frame needs as outcomes, not features.

### Scale Design

- **Stage performance**
  - Use 5-point satisfaction or effectiveness scales.
  - Anchors must be stage-specific (e.g., “Very ineffective” to “Very effective”).

- **Ease / Effort**
  - Use 5-point ease scales.
  - Keep direction consistent (easy → difficult or vice versa).

- **Emotional response**
  - Use a fixed list of emotion descriptors.
  - Binary or intensity-based (e.g., “Did you feel frustrated?” Yes/No).

- **Importance**
  - Use 5-point importance scales.
  - Ask importance separately from performance.

- **Consistency rules**
  - Do not mix scale orientations across stages.
  - Do not change scale length within a repeated block.

### Sample Questions

**Stage Confirmation**
> Which of the following stages did you personally experience as part of your most recent \[JOURNEY]?  
> - Became aware of options  
> - Researched and compared  
> - Selected a provider  
> - Purchased or signed up  
> - Used the product or service  
> - Sought support or follow-up  

**Stage Performance**
> Thinking about the **research and comparison** stage, how effective was this stage at helping you make a decision?  
> - Very ineffective  
> - Somewhat ineffective  
> - Neither effective nor ineffective  
> - Somewhat effective  
> - Very effective  

**Touchpoints**
> Which of the following did you use during this stage? (Select all that apply)  
> - Brand website  
> - Online reviews  
> - In-store staff  
> - Friends or family  
> - Social media  
> - Other (specify)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Asking about the journey as a single experience**  
  *Wrong:* “How satisfied were you with your overall journey?”  
  *Correct:* Measure satisfaction separately for each stage  
  *Why it matters:* Overall scores hide stage-level failure.

- **Using vague stages**
  *Wrong:* “Before purchase” / “After purchase”  
  *Correct:* Clearly defined stages with specific behaviors  
  *Why it matters:* Ambiguous stages cannot guide action.

- **Mixing expectations and experiences**
  *Wrong:* “The experience met my expectations.”  
  *Correct:* Separate what happened from whether it met expectations  
  *Why it matters:* Expectations vary widely and obscure root causes.

- **Overloading stages with attributes**
  *Wrong:* 15+ ratings per stage  
  *Correct:* Focus on 5–7 critical measures per stage  
  *Why it matters:* Cognitive fatigue degrades recall quality.

- **Ignoring non-linear paths**
  *Wrong:* Forcing all respondents through all stages  
  *Correct:* Route based on actual experienced stages  
  *Why it matters:* Real journeys vary; forcing linearity distorts insight.

## Analysis & Output Requirements

The survey must enable the following analyses:

- **Journey visualization**
  - Stage completion rates
  - Drop-off and looping behavior

- **Stage performance diagnostics**
  - Satisfaction or effectiveness by stage
  - Identification of weakest and strongest stages

- **Touchpoint contribution**
  - Touchpoint usage by stage
  - Association between touchpoints and outcomes

- **Pain point identification**
  - Frequency and severity of issues by stage
  - Prioritization of fixable friction

- **Emotional journey**
  - Emotional highs and lows across stages
  - Correlation of emotion with satisfaction and loyalty

- **Moments of truth**
  - Stages with disproportionate impact on outcomes
  - Key drivers of success or failure

- **Sample size guidance**
  - Minimum n=300 completed journeys
  - n=500+ recommended for robust stage-level segmentation
  - Ensure sufficient base per stage after routing

- **Data structure**
  - Stage variables must be consistently named and ordered
  - Touchpoints captured as binary indicators per stage
  - Clear flags for skipped or unexperienced stages

---

## Integration with Other Methods

- **Usability Testing**
  Journey mapping identifies where usability testing should focus, but does not replace task-level observation.

- **U&A Research**
  Journey mapping builds on U&A by adding temporal and experiential structure.

- **Brand Tracking**
  Stage satisfaction can contextualize overall brand scores.

- **NPS / CSAT**
  Journey stages help explain why promoters or detractors feel as they do.
