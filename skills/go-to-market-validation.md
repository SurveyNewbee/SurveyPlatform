  Validates launch readiness by testing targeting, value proposition, pricing, messaging, and channels as an integrated system rather than isolated components. Use in the final pre-launch phase when all GTM elements are defined and need system-level validation before commercial investment. Tests realistic launch bundles through staged disclosure that mirrors the actual buying journey to identify weak-link risks and execution blockers.

# Go-to-Market Validation (Launch Readiness Research)

## Overview
Go-to-Market (GTM) Validation is an integrated research methodology used to **de-risk product or offer launches** by testing whether the right customers, value proposition, price, messaging, and channels work together coherently. It is used in the final pre-launch phase to confirm readiness, identify weak links, and prioritize fixes before committing significant commercial spend.

This methodology focuses on **system-level validation**, not isolated optimizations. A launch only succeeds if all components reinforce one another in real decision contexts.

## Core Principles
- **Validate the system, not the parts.** GTM elements must be tested in realistic combinations, not as disconnected modules.
- **Anchor feedback to decision moments.** Respondents must evaluate the offer as they would when actually deciding to buy, adopt, or switch.
- **Prioritize failure detection over marginal lift.** The goal is to surface blockers, confusion, or misalignment before launch.
- **Sequence tests to mirror the buying journey.** Awareness → understanding → value assessment → price evaluation → action.
- **Force trade-offs.** Respondents must choose between realistic alternatives, not rate everything in isolation.
- **Design for actionability.** Outputs must clearly indicate what to fix, what to keep, and what to deprioritize.

## Survey Design Requirements

### Question Structure
- **Always use an end-to-end flow that mirrors market exposure:**
  1. Targeting and relevance check
  2. Problem recognition
  3. Value proposition comprehension
  4. Messaging clarity and differentiation
  5. Price evaluation
  6. Channel and purchase friction
  7. Overall launch confidence
- **Expose respondents to a coherent launch package.**
  - Product description, value proposition, price, and channel context must be shown together where possible.
- **Use staged disclosure.**
  - Introduce information progressively to observe where understanding or interest breaks down.
- **Include forced-choice decision points.**
  - Example: choose between new offer vs current solution vs no purchase.
- **Separate diagnostic questions from decision questions.**
  - Never interrupt a decision task with attitudinal probes.
- **If multiple segments or markets are involved, use parallel designs.**
  - Do not mix fundamentally different GTM strategies in a single cell.

### Scale Design
- **Use 5-point likelihood or agreement scales for decision readiness.**
  - Example: “Very unlikely” → “Very likely”
- **Use clarity and confidence scales for messaging diagnostics.**
  - Example: “Not at all clear” → “Extremely clear”
- **Price evaluation must use explicit reference points.**
  - Anchor prices to respondent’s current spend, category norms, or budget thresholds.
- **Maintain consistent scales across GTM elements** to enable relative diagnostics.
- **Avoid neutral midpoints** for go/no-go questions.

### Sample Questions
**Targeting Validation**
- “How relevant is this type of product or service to your current needs?”
  - 1 = Not at all relevant
  - 5 = Extremely relevant

**Value Proposition Comprehension**
- “In your own words, what problem does this offer solve?”
  - Open-ended, coded for accuracy

**Price Evaluation**
- “At a price of $49 per month, how likely would you be to consider this offer?”
  - 1 = Very unlikely
  - 5 = Very likely

**Forced Choice**
- “If these were your only options, which would you choose?”
  - This new offer
  - Your current solution
  - Neither / would delay decision

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Testing components in isolation.**
  - *Wrong:* Testing messaging without price or product context.
  - *Correct:* Presenting a realistic launch bundle.
- **Over-indexing on stated excitement.**
  - Excitement without choice or trade-off data is misleading.
- **Using generic purchase intent questions.**
  - GTM validation requires context-specific intent.
- **Ignoring channel friction.**
  - A strong offer can still fail due to access, onboarding, or distribution issues.
- **Allowing respondents to say “everything works.”**
  - Force prioritization and rejection.
- **Collapsing diagnostics into a single score.**
  - GTM failure is usually localized, not universal.

## Analysis & Output Requirements
- **Outputs must identify weakest-link risks.**
  - Targeting mismatch
  - Value confusion
  - Price resistance
  - Channel friction
- **Report results by segment.**
  - GTM fit is rarely uniform across audiences.
- **Key metrics typically include:**
  - Relevance qualification rate
  - Message comprehension accuracy
  - Consideration and choice share
  - Price sensitivity indicators
  - Drop-off points in the decision journey
- **Sample size guidance:**
  - Minimum 150–200 completes per core target segment
  - Larger samples if multiple GTM variants are tested
- **Use scenario-based analysis.**
  - Compare “current plan” vs “optimized plan” projections.
- **Clearly distinguish fixable issues from structural misfit.**
  - Not all problems can be solved with messaging.

## Integration with Other Methods
- **Concept Testing:** GTM validation follows successful concept screening.
- **Pricing Studies:** Use validated price ranges rather than exploratory price testing.
- **Message Testing:** Embed best-performing messages into GTM flows.
- **Market Sizing:** Translate validated demand into revenue scenarios.
- **Product Use Testing:** Confirm that experienced value matches GTM promise.
