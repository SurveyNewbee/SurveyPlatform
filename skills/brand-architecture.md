description: |
  Evaluates and designs brand portfolios, sub-brands, and naming structures by testing how customers understand brand relationships and roles within complete systems. Use when managing multiple brands, extensions, or product lines that need to balance clarity, differentiation, and equity leverage. Tests complete portfolio structures (not isolated names) to optimize customer comprehension, brand role clarity, and strategic scalability. Not suitable for single-brand positioning, early naming exploration, or simple brand preference studies.

# Brand Architecture Research (Portfolio & Brand System Design)

## Overview
Brand Architecture Research is a methodology used to **evaluate, design, or optimize how brands, sub-brands, and offerings are structured and presented** within a portfolio. It is applied when organizations manage multiple brands, extensions, or product lines and need to balance clarity, differentiation, and equity leverage.

This methodology ensures that customers can **easily understand what exists, how things relate, and what each brand stands for**, while supporting strategic growth decisions.

## Core Principles
- **Clarity beats cleverness.** Customers must immediately understand the role of each brand or sub-brand.
- **Equity should be deliberately leveraged.** Parent brand strength must be used intentionally, not assumed.
- **Architecture reflects strategy.** The brand system must mirror how the business intends to grow.
- **Customer logic overrides internal logic.** Internal org charts or P&Ls are not valid structuring principles.
- **Trade-offs are unavoidable.** Differentiation, flexibility, and simplicity cannot all be maximized simultaneously.
- **Architecture must scale.** Designs must anticipate future extensions and acquisitions.

## Survey Design Requirements

### Question Structure
- **Begin with current-state comprehension.**
  - Assess how well customers understand the existing brand structure.
- **Introduce alternative architectures as systems, not fragments.**
  - Always show complete portfolios, not isolated brand names.
- **Use monadic or sequential monadic testing.**
  - Do not show multiple architectures side-by-side unless explicitly testing comparison behavior.
- **Control information exposure.**
  - Present brand relationships visually or textually in a consistent format.
- **Sequence evaluation as follows:**
  1. Overall clarity and understanding
  2. Perceived relationships between brands
  3. Role clarity of each brand or tier
  4. Equity transfer and credibility
  5. Fit for future offerings
- **Include forced interpretation tasks.**
  - Ask respondents to explain what each brand does in their own words.
- **Avoid asking preference before comprehension.**
  - Preference without understanding is invalid.

### Scale Design
- **Use 5-point clarity and fit scales.**
  - Example: “Not at all clear” → “Extremely clear”
- **Equity transfer should be measured explicitly.**
  - Example: confidence, trust, or quality inference.
- **Use consistent scales across all architectures tested.**
- **Avoid midpoint-heavy designs.**
  - Clarity assessments must discriminate.
- **Do not use purchase intent as a primary metric.**
  - Architecture is upstream of buying decisions.

### Sample Questions
**Clarity Assessment**
- “How clear is your understanding of how these brands relate to one another?”
  - 1 = Not at all clear
  - 5 = Extremely clear

**Role Diagnostic**
- “In your own words, what does each of the following brands specialize in?”
  - Open-ended, coded for accuracy and differentiation

**Equity Transfer**
- “Knowing that this product comes from [parent brand], how does that affect your confidence in its quality?”
  - 1 = Decreases confidence significantly
  - 5 = Increases confidence significantly

**Future Fit**
- “How well would this brand structure support adding new products or services in the future?”
  - 1 = Not at all well
  - 5 = Extremely well

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Testing brand names without structure.**
  - *Wrong:* Evaluating sub-brand names in isolation.
  - *Correct:* Testing them within a full portfolio context.
- **Over-indexing on liking.**
  - Liking does not equal understanding or scalability.
- **Ignoring misattribution.**
  - Customers assigning the wrong meaning to brands is a critical failure.
- **Using internal language.**
  - Descriptors must be customer-facing, not corporate jargon.
- **Collapsing architecture into a single score.**
  - Trade-offs must remain visible.
- **Assuming consistency equals strength.**
  - Over-unification can dilute meaning.

## Analysis & Output Requirements
- **Primary evaluation dimensions:**
  - Structural clarity
  - Brand role differentiation
  - Equity leverage vs dilution
  - Strategic flexibility
  - Error and confusion rates
- **Code open-ended responses rigorously.**
  - Correct understanding
  - Partial understanding
  - Misinterpretation
- **Compare architectures on a dashboard, not a rank order.**
  - Each option will win on different dimensions.
- **Sample size guidance:**
  - Minimum 150–200 completes per architecture tested
- **Segment analysis is mandatory.**
  - Different customer groups often interpret structures differently.
- **Deliver explicit recommendations.**
  - Which architecture to adopt
  - Which brands need clearer roles
  - Where naming or endorsement rules must change

## Integration with Other Methods
- **Brand Positioning:** Architecture sets the container for positioning work.
- **Naming Testing:** Naming follows architecture decisions, not the reverse.
- **Go-to-Market Validation:** Ensure GTM plans align with brand roles.
- **Segmentation:** Different segments may require different brand emphasis.
- **M&A Research:** Use architecture research to plan brand integration.

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Architectures are tested as complete, coherent systems
- [ ] Clarity is assessed before preference
- [ ] Equity transfer is explicitly measured
- [ ] Open-ended diagnostics reveal misinterpretation
- [ ] Trade-offs between options are preserved
- [ ] Results support a clear architectural recommendation
- [ ] Design accounts for future growth and extensions
- [ ] Outputs translate into concrete brand governance rules
