name: dei-research
description: |
  Measures diversity, equity, and inclusion experiences across demographic groups to identify systemic inequities in access, treatment, and outcomes. Use when diagnosing gaps between organizational intent and lived reality, or when tracking progress on inclusion initiatives. Focuses on behavioral experiences and process fairness rather than representation metrics or aspirational statements. Not suitable for surface-level sentiment measurement, small samples (<300), or punitive evaluation of individuals.

# DEI Research (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Diagnostics)

## Overview
DEI Research is a methodology used to **understand how diverse groups experience an organization, product, or system**, and to identify inequities in access, treatment, opportunity, and outcomes. It is applied to diagnose gaps between intent and reality, prioritize interventions, and track progress over time.

This methodology focuses on **lived experience, systemic fairness, and behavioral outcomes**, not symbolic representation or surface-level sentiment.

## Core Principles
- **Experience defines inclusion.** Inclusion is measured by how people are treated and enabled, not by stated values.
- **Equity requires comparison.** Outcomes must be evaluated across groups, not in aggregate.
- **Context matters.** DEI experiences vary by role, level, function, geography, and tenure.
- **Psychological safety is non-negotiable.** Honest data requires anonymity and trust.
- **Discomfort is diagnostic.** Avoiding sensitive topics weakens insight.
- **Actionability over optics.** Findings must point to fixable systems and behaviors.

## Survey Design Requirements

### Question Structure
- **Begin with opt-in demographic and identity measures.**
  - Clearly explain purpose and confidentiality.
  - Allow “prefer not to say” for all sensitive items.
- **Separate identity from experience.**
  - Identity questions first, experiences later.
- **Structure the survey in the following order:**
  1. Sense of belonging and inclusion
  2. Access to opportunity and resources
  3. Fairness of processes (hiring, promotion, evaluation)
  4. Everyday behaviors and micro-experiences
  5. Psychological safety and voice
  6. Leadership accountability and response
  7. Outcomes and intent (stay, recommend, escalate)
- **Use behaviorally anchored questions.**
  - Ask what happens, not what should happen.
- **Include incident-based questions where appropriate.**
  - Time-bound and specific.
- **Avoid asking marginalized groups to speak for others.**
  - Each respondent reports their own experience only.

### Scale Design
- **Use 5-point frequency or agreement scales.**
  - Example: “Never” → “Very often”
- **Maintain identical scales across demographic groups.**
- **Use fairness scales explicitly.**
  - Example: “Very unfair” → “Very fair”
- **Avoid neutral-heavy or vague scales.**
- **Include “not applicable” only where exposure differs.**

### Sample Questions
**Belonging**
- “I feel like I belong at this organization.”
  - 1 = Strongly disagree
  - 5 = Strongly agree

**Equitable Access**
- “People like me have equal access to growth opportunities.”
  - 1 = Strongly disagree
  - 5 = Strongly agree

**Behavioral Experience**
- “In the past 12 months, how often have you felt dismissed or talked over at work?”
  - Never
  - Rarely
  - Sometimes
  - Often
  - Very often

**Psychological Safety**
- “I feel safe speaking up about concerns related to fairness or inclusion.”
  - 1 = Strongly disagree
  - 5 = Strongly agree

**Leadership Response**
- “When issues related to inclusion are raised, leaders take them seriously.”
  - 1 = Strongly disagree
  - 5 = Strongly agree

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Measuring representation instead of experience.**
  - *Wrong:* Counting demographics only.
  - *Correct:* Measuring how systems treat people.
- **Over-aggregating results.**
  - Averages hide inequities.
- **Using aspirational language.**
  - Aspirations are not diagnostics.
- **Ignoring majority-group experiences.**
  - Inclusion dynamics involve everyone.
- **Failing to close the loop.**
  - Asking without acting erodes trust.
- **Using DEI data punitively.**
  - Breaks psychological safety.

## Analysis & Output Requirements
- **Primary analytical lenses:**
  - Outcome gaps by demographic group
  - Experience gaps at key moments
  - Process fairness diagnostics
  - Psychological safety levels
- **Analyze dispersion and outliers.**
  - Extreme negative experiences are critical signals.
- **Segment rigorously:**
  - Intersectional analysis where sample allows
  - Role, level, and tenure overlays
- **Sample size guidance:**
  - Census preferred
  - Minimum 300 responses for stable group comparison
- **Report gaps, not just scores.**
  - Differences between groups are the insight.
- **Translate findings into interventions.**
  - Policy changes
  - Manager training
  - Process redesign
- **Plan for longitudinal tracking.**
  - Fixed questions and scales over time.

## Integration with Other Methods
- **Culture Change Research:** DEI gaps often reflect broader cultural norms.
- **Employee Engagement:** Inclusion is a driver, not an outcome.
- **Employer Brand Research:** External claims must match internal reality.
- **Leadership 360s:** Diagnose leader-specific behaviors.
- **Ethnography:** Deepen understanding of lived experience.

- [ ] Analysis compares groups explicitly
- [ ] Psychological safety is assessed
- [ ] Leadership accountability is evaluated
