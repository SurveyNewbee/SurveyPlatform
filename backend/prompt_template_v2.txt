Read the research brief below and apply your expertise in market research methodology and survey design to produce two things:

1. A structured extraction of the research parameters (what the research needs)
2. A survey blueprint specifying sections, question types, flow, and LOI estimate (how to build it)

Identify the study type from the brief — it could be any kind of quantitative research (concept test, brand tracker, segmentation, U&A, market sizing, pricing study, ad test, customer satisfaction, or anything else). Design the blueprint to match what that study type requires methodologically. The JSON schema below is your output format, not a constraint on your thinking.

--------------------
TASK PLANNING (REQUIRED)
--------------------

Before producing any JSON, you MUST think through the brief by writing a TASK_PLAN block.

Your TASK_PLAN must address each of these steps in order:

1. OBJECTIVE: What is the core research question? What decision will this inform?
2. AUDIENCE: Who qualifies? What screening criteria are stated or implied?
3. METHODOLOGY: What is the primary methodology? Are there secondary components?
4. SAMPLE DESIGN: What quotas are stated? What is the total sample size? Are there hard vs soft quotas?
5. STUDY STRUCTURE: How many stimuli? How are they exposed? What comparisons are needed?
6. COMPETITIVE CONTEXT: Is there a client brand? Who are the competitors? What category?
   - Does the category have private label / store brands? If yes, they MUST be included in competitor_brands.
   - Does the brief define a price tier or segment focus? If yes, the brand list must be consistent with that scope.
7. ANALYSIS NEEDS: What outputs does the client expect? What analyses are implied?
8. COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Beyond what the brief explicitly asks, what data would help the client
   act on the results? Think about what happens AFTER the research — the sales meeting, the
   retailer pitch, the packaging brief, the media buy. Consider:
   - Does the client need to position against specific competitors? If yes, the survey should
     include direct head-to-head comparison, not just separate brand ratings.
   - Will the client need to forecast volume or justify shelf space? If yes, include replacement/
     cannibalization intent (would this replace, supplement, or be a one-time trial vs current brand).
   - Are there individual claims, features, or copy elements that need testing beyond overall
     positioning? If yes, include claim-level purchase drivers.
   - Can concept/stimulus content be enriched from brief details? If the brief provides product
     attributes, flavor descriptions, or positioning elements, the blueprint should instruct
     the survey builder to craft realized stimulus copy — not just say "client to provide."
   Only add what fits within LOI. If the brief is already tight on time, note these as optional
   sections with lower priority rather than omitting them entirely.
9. OPERATIONAL: What LOI, fieldwork mode, or quality requirements are mentioned?
10. BLUEPRINT DECISIONS: Based on everything above, what survey structure is needed?
   - What sections should the survey contain and in what order?
   - What question types are needed per section?
   - What experimental design is required (if any)?
   - What is the estimated LOI? Is it realistic for the content needed?
   - What are the critical piping chains and skip logic paths?
11. STUDY TYPE CHECKLIST: Based on the study_type and primary_methodology identified above,
    verify the blueprint includes every component standard to this study type.

    The checks below cover common study types where specific design patterns matter.
    For any study type not listed here, apply the same rigor — verify the blueprint
    covers all standard methodological components for that approach.

    If study involves brand tracking, brand health, market share, or competitive positioning:
    - [ ] Blueprint includes a brand awareness section (unaided + aided) BEFORE any brand evaluation
    - [ ] Blueprint includes a brand funnel (awareness → consideration → usage → loyalty)
    - [ ] Brand list includes private label / store brands if the category has them
    - [ ] Switching section uses FROM → TO brand design: "Did you switch?" → "Previous brand?" →
          "Current brand?" → "Why?" — NOT separate "brands started" / "brands stopped" questions

    If study involves market share measurement:
    - [ ] Share of wallet uses allocation method (distribute 100% across brands), NOT broad bands
    - [ ] Blueprint notes mention Nielsen/IRI alignment considerations if relevant
    - [ ] Purchase frequency questions need a respondent-facing definition of "purchase occasion"

    If study involves tracking or longitudinal measurement:
    - [ ] Attribute batteries flagged as "must match baseline" if prior wave exists
    - [ ] Blueprint notes flag which sections are core (repeat every wave) vs rotating

    If study involves segmentation:
    - [ ] Attitudinal battery items are consistent in scale and framing (suitable for cluster input)
    - [ ] Behavioral inputs are structured as segment discriminators
    - [ ] Brand/product evaluation positioned AFTER segmentation inputs to avoid priming

    If brief mentions temporal forecasting (CAGR, 5-year, growth projection, adoption curve):
    - [ ] Blueprint includes adoption timeline question with specific time bands
    - [ ] If B2B: includes business growth trajectory inputs

    If study involves purchase frequency, volume, or occasion-based measurement:
    - [ ] Respondent-facing definition needed in blueprint section notes
    - [ ] Usage frequency and purchase frequency are distinguished — do not conflate them

    If study involves derived metrics (SCR, TAM/SAM/SOM, brand equity indices, market sizing):
    - [ ] Blueprint notes instruct survey builder to include metric formulas tied to question IDs

12. GAPS: What is NOT specified that the survey builder will need to decide?

--------------------
SELF-VALIDATION (REQUIRED)
--------------------

After your TASK_PLAN and before outputting JSON, you MUST write a VALIDATION block.

```
VALIDATION:
- [ ] objective is a complete sentence describing the decision this research informs
- [ ] target_audience includes enough detail to write screener questions
- [ ] key_dimensions are specific and measurable, not vague themes
- [ ] Every brand mentioned in the brief appears in market_context.competitor_brands or client_brand
- [ ] If category has private label / store brands, they appear in competitor_brands
- [ ] Brand list boundaries match the brief's category definition and price tier scope
- [ ] Quotas have matching groups that cover the brief's requirements (not invented)
- [ ] study_type and primary_methodology are consistent with each other
- [ ] If stimuli are described in the brief, stimuli_content captures them (not discarded)
- [ ] required_outputs are specific enough to determine what question types are needed
- [ ] Blueprint sections cover all key_dimensions
- [ ] Blueprint LOI estimate is realistic for the question count
- [ ] Blueprint experimental design matches the exposure_design and comparison_intent
- [ ] If study involves brands: blueprint has awareness section before evaluation sections
- [ ] If study involves switching: blueprint notes specify FROM → TO design
- [ ] If study involves purchase measurement: blueprint notes flag need for "purchase" definition
- [ ] All STUDY TYPE CHECKLIST items from step 10 are satisfied
- [ ] No fields are invented — anything not in the brief is null
```

Fix any issues before outputting the JSON.

After the TASK_PLAN and VALIDATION, output a single valid JSON object with no additional text.

--------------------
EXTRACTION RULES
--------------------

- If the brief does NOT clearly support a field, set its value to null or empty array.
- Do NOT infer or invent details not reasonably stated or implied.
- Be concise but preserve critical details.
- Use complete sentences for objective and target_audience.
- Ensure all text is properly escaped for JSON.

--------------------
JSON SCHEMA
--------------------

The JSON object MUST contain ALL of the following top-level fields.

=====================
SECTION 1: CORE RESEARCH INTENT
=====================

- objective: STRING. Primary research goal as a complete sentence focused on what decisions this informs.
- target_audience: STRING. Who the research targets, including demographics, behaviours, or characteristics for screener criteria.
- key_dimensions: ARRAY of STRINGS. Specific, measurable topics the research must address. At least one item.
- market_context: OBJECT or null.
  {{
